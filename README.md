# 🌟 Experimenting with AI to Build My Portfolio 🌟

Recently, I decided to test the capabilities of some of the latest AI models, including the preview model, with one interesting question in mind:

🤖 **"Can AI help me build a professional portfolio?"**

I challenged it with this prompt, and after several iterations, suggestions, and improvements, **here’s the result!**

My new portfolio is a sleek, interactive site that not only reflects my journey as a Backend Developer but also integrates sophisticated frontend elements—thanks to **Tailwind CSS** and **Swiper JS**—making the site both dynamic and engaging.

## Here’s what the AI-powered portfolio includes:

### Elegant Design & Responsiveness 🖥️📱
The design is minimal yet modern, with smooth transitions and custom hover effects. It’s fully responsive, making it compatible with any device.

### Showcasing Key Projects 🚀
AI even helped to organize my featured projects, like:
- `htmx-golang-ecommerce`
- `easycab`
- `calculator-interpreter`
- `FullStack-app`

Each project is instantly accessible, enhancing the user experience.

### Interactive Skills Section 🛠️
The site includes an interactive skills section where clicking on an icon redirects to the official page of each technology, allowing visitors to explore more about my tech stack.

### Multi-Language Support 🌐
With the help of AI, I implemented a language toggle, letting users view the site in **English** or **Spanish**, enhancing accessibility for a broader audience.

## Why This Was Worth the Experiment 💡
It’s one thing to see AI generate text or ideas, but seeing it actively assist in structuring a professional portfolio felt like a real leap in practical AI application. The preview model was able to integrate tailored UI suggestions and provided valuable feedback on improving code efficiency.

## Conclusion

Through this experience, I've noticed that while AI can generate some fairly decent code, it often encounters issues that need troubleshooting. In fact, using AI to speed up the process can sometimes backfire; you may find yourself fixing errors or restructuring code, ultimately spending more time than if you’d written it yourself. Plus, there's the risk of missing out on learning certain concepts firsthand, only to end up learning them anyway while debugging.

For simple tasks, AI proves to be a very useful tool. But when it comes to tackling more complex problems, it's clear that AI isn’t a complete replacement. Where it truly shines is as a **source of information**—presenting concepts like study notes, which can be more helpful than generating the code itself.
